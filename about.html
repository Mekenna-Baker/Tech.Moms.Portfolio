        <p class="intro-p">Born in Auburn, Washington, I was the youngest of four. However, that status was short-lived.
            After my parents' divorce, two cross-country moves, and settling down in Utah, I was bumped to middle child
            status.
            I grew up in a suburb of Salt Lake City, Utah, known as Sandy. I lived with my father, step-mother, older
            sister, and younger sister. My eldest 2 sisters resided in Indiana with my mother. Growing up we developed
            annual family trips. We would visit places like Moab, Gooseberry, Duck Creek, and California. These were
            trips that we looked forward to all year.

        <p class="graduation-p">From the outside looking in, my upbringing probably seemed pretty normal. However, on
            the inside, it was full of physical, and emotional abuse, as well as neglect. When I graduated high school
            at Jordan High in 2015, my parents surprised me by selling our house and moving without me. I had assumed I
            was going along with them, but suddenly found myself staying with my grandma, who thankfully welcomed me
            with open arms.
            I soon got a part time job, and enrolled full time at Salt Lake Community
            college. In high school I had taken concurrent enrollement classes for criminal justice, and I had also been
            apart of Sandy City Polices' Explorer Program. This background combined with my upbringing motivated me to
            study social work, hoping to eventually become a social worker, and help prevent what happend to me,
            from happening to others. Unfortunately, my own health issues threw a wrench in my plans. I had to take
            breaks from school several
            times, and eventually, it became too much to handle financially, trying to cover both tuition and medical
            bills.

        <img class="family" src="./kaden.silas.jpg" alt="son on dads shoulders" height="475" width="600">

        <p class="family-p"> I met my husband, Kaden, in my first semester of college, alongside some of our other very
            close friends. Our friend group was always hanging out and doing something, and Kaden didn't show up very
            often. This led my best friend and I to try to include him more, and eventually we were hanging out all the
            time. We started dating at the end of 2016, and got married in 2019, just before we moved to Indiana later
            that year. We moved to Indiana so I could try to reconnect with my eldest sisters, and some of my other
            family from my mother's side. While we were out there, the pandemic hit, and the area slowly started to
            become more dangerous to be in. We moved back to Utah, and got back to <i>mostly</i> normal life. Within the
            next year or so, we found out we were expecting, and at the beginning of 2022, we welcomed our sweet son,
            Silas, to the world.
